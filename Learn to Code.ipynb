Contest picks a door, Monty Hall shows the contestant that nothing of value is behind 98 of the other doors, and then asks if contestant wants to stick with original choice or switch to the one remaining door. In this example, the contestant clearly had a 1/100 chance of getting car on first try, but if contestant switches, there is a 99/100 chance the car will be behind the remaining door.

    "  * start with a list of all of the numbers from 2 up to the given number, e.g., if the given number if 25, you'd start with __`[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]`__\n",

    "  * try your solution with large numbers and compare against list of primes (e.g., https://miniwebtool.com/list-of-prime-numbers/)\n",
    "  * removing the multiples from the list is fairly inefficient, and you should notice your program slowing down considerably with large numbers, so now try setting the multiples to 0, rather than removing them, e.g.,\n",
